# Netplan Configuration Guide

1. Change directory to `/etc/netplan/`:

```sh
cd /etc/netplan/
```

2. Check the network adapter:

```sh
ip addr
```

3. List files in the `/etc/netplan/` directory:

```sh
ls /etc/netplan/
```

4. Create a backup of the existing configuration file:

```sh
sudo cp /etc/netplan/<your-config-file>.yaml /etc/netplan/<your-config-file>.yaml.bak
```

5. Edit the YAML file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/netplan/<your-config-file>.yaml
```

6. Add the following content to the file:


Note: You can also use the ```ip route show``` command to verify your default gateway configuration

```yaml
# This is the network config written by 'subiquity'
network:
 version: 2
 renderer: networkd
 ethernets:
   eth0:
     dhcp4: no
     addresses: [192.168.84.53/24]
     gateway4: 192.168.84.1
     nameservers:
         addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.8.4]
```

**Note:** Make sure the file is correctly indented.

7. Apply the configuration:

```sh
sudo netplan apply
```
