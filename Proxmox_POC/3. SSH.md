# SSH Guide

## Generating SSH Keys

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

## Adding Private Key to the Key-Agent

```bash
ssh-add DIR_PATH/keypairforssh
```

## Connecting to Remote Host via SSH

```bash
ssh [username]@hostname
```

If the private key is not added to the key agent, use:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/private/key/file username@hostname
```

## Prerequisites

- Your destination server should have SSH enabled.
- You should have generated public and private SSH keys (use `ssh-keygen -t rsa`).
- You should have a user account and password on the server (root account will also work).
- You should know the IP address of the server.

## Copying SSH Key to Server

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub YOUR_USER_NAME@IP_ADDRESS_OF_THE_SERVER
```

### Alternative Method

#### Step 1: Get the Public Key

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

#### Step 2: Create SSH Directory in User’s Home Directory

Create directories and files in the end user’s home directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/user_name/.ssh && touch /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Add the public key to the `authorized_keys` file:

```bash
vim /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### Step 3: Set Appropriate Permissions

Set the correct file permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 /home/user_name/.ssh && chmod 600 /home/user_name/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Change the ownership to the user:

```bash
chown -R username:username /home/username/.ssh
```

## Security

### Changing the Default SSH Port

1. Open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file for editing.
2. Locate the line with `Port 22` (remove `#` if present).
3. Change the line to `Port 2522` (or any number between 1024 and 65535).
4. Ensure the new port is allowed by firewalls.
5. Restart SSH daemon:

	```bash
	sudo systemctl restart sshd
	```

From now on, specify the port to connect:

```bash
ssh user@ip_address_of_server -p 2522
```

### Logging Out a User from SSH Session

Check the list of logged-in users:

```bash
who -u
```

Terminate the session:

```bash
sudo kill -HUP process_id
```

Send a message before terminating the session:

```bash
echo "Your session will end in 2 minutes. Save your work!" | write prakash pts/2
```

## Transferring Files

### Using `rsync`

#### File

```bash
rsync filename username@ip_address:/home/username
```

#### Directory

```bash
rsync -r source_dir username@ip_address:/home/username/target_dir
```

## Notes

- The `nohup` command allows you to keep running commands even after disconnecting your SSH connection.
- Disable SSH password authentication.
- Use tools like `fail2ban`.
- Use SSH Config File to manage SSH connections to various remote servers:

	```bash
	touch ~/.ssh/config
	```

### Order of SSH Configuration

1. Command-line options
2. User’s configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`)
3. System-wide configuration file (`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`)

## SSH Security Hardening

- Disable empty passwords.
- Change default SSH ports.
- Disable root login via SSH.
- Configure idle timeout interval.
- Allow SSH access to selected users only.
- Mitigate brute force attacks automatically (Fail2ban).
- Disable password-based SSH login.
- Enable two-factor authentication with SSH.

## ASSH: An Advanced Way to Interact with SSH

ASSH (Advanced SSH Config) is a wrapper for SSH that allows dynamic and advanced management of SSH configurations.
